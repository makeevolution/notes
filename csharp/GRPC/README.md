TLDR:
- GRPC consists of server and client
- GRPC server contains two folders: protos and services
- Protos are interfaces/contracts; see the greet.proto for more information on how it looks like
  - For each contract there are one or more services, and each service has a request and reply (e.g. input and output)
- The services folder implements the contract; see the files there on how it is done

- The GRPC client needs the three Nuget packages installed in the .csproj there.
- Once installed, copy paste the protos folder from the GrpcServer to the client.
  - Then change the namespace to `GrpcClient` (since we are in the client side).
- So both projects must have the same protos folder (same interface).
- Note that `grpc.tools` will create a section in `GrpcClient.csproj` called `Protobuf`. 
- There is a bug in the autogenerated section; make sure `GrpcServices` is set to `Client` instead of `Server`!
  - Setting it as `Server` (as is the case in the GrpcServer project) gives you the `GreeterBase`, while setting it as
    `Client` gives you `GreeterClient` (as is in GrpcClient project).

- Run both projects and see the client got a response from the server.
- Note that the server and the client has no reference to each other!
