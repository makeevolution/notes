GRPC benefits vs. REST:
- In GRPC, the "endpoints" are auto generated by the package that compiles our `.proto` file. We get async variants also
  out of the box, and variants of it.
  - This makes it nicer compared to REST, where in REST you have to create your controllers, endpoints etc. by hand.
  - This also makes our development highly focused on the interface/contract (i.e. `proto`) file, thus encouraging API first design.

TLDR:
- GRPC consists of server and client
- GRPC server contains two folders: protos and services
- Protos are interfaces/contracts; see the greet.proto for more information on how it looks like
  - For each contract there are one or more services, and each service has a request and reply (e.g. input and output)
- The services folder implements the contract; see the files there on how it is done

- The GRPC client needs the three Nuget packages installed in the .csproj there.
- Once installed, copy paste the protos folder from the GrpcServer to the client.
  - Then change the namespace to `GrpcClient` (since we are in the client side).
- So both projects must have the same protos folder (same interface).
- Note that `grpc.tools` will create a section in `GrpcClient.csproj` called `Protobuf`. 
- There is a bug in the autogenerated section; make sure `GrpcServices` is set to `Client` instead of `Server`!
  - Setting it as `Server` (as is the case in the GrpcServer project) gives you the `GreeterBase`, while setting it as
    `Client` gives you `GreeterClient` (as is in GrpcClient project).

- Run both projects and see the client got a response from the server.
- Everytime you make a change, must `dotnet clean` and `dotnet build` otherwise it won't register the new changes.
- Note that the server and the client has no project reference to each other!

- When we add a new proto (e.g. the customers.proto in server), do not forget to check that the build properties is set
  correctly: ![Schermafbeelding 2025-11-29 220649.png](Images/Schermafbeelding%202025-11-29%20220649.png)
  - Then, reload project/build. What this does is the Grpc package (either `Grpc.AspNetCore` or `Grpc.Net.Client`) will
    create the service specified in the `proto` file as a csharp class in `obj`, and you can use it in your services.
  - Only then, you create your service class for the proto in `Services`
  - Don't forget to register the service in `Program.cs`
